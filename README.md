# React Nanodegree - Mobile Flashcards

A simple mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app allows users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks. This project is built for the [React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)
